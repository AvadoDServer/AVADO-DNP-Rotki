2. You can also open <https://rotki.my.ava.do/> to open outside of the Avado UI. Note that this still requires an active VPN connection.
3. Check your IP address in the Avado UI and open <https://your-ip-address:4443> to open Rotki on your local network without an active VPN. *Note that you need to trust your network to do this.*
